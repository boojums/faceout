Chrome Extension for getting out of dumpster-fire-chase-mode and into action.

Currently all this does is redirect your Facebook tab to 5calls.org after you've been there for 5 minutes.

Lots of possibilities for creative improvements. At least 1.5 million possibilities.

To use:

- Download source
- Go to chrome://extensions in your browser
- Make sure Developer mode is checked
- Load unpacked extension...
- Find the inner faceout directory on your computer's file system
- Enjoy. 
(It doesn't do much and may break.)
